# INTRODUCTION TO BLOCKCHAIN DATA ANALYTICS: Bufficorn NFT



This workshop is an introduction to blockchain data analysis for people interested in coding and data analytics/science. Workshop will be friendly for code beginners with python knowledge. Bring your laptop and code along! Starting point is a short introduction to blockchain data analytics, its use-cases and an overview of toolings for blockchain data analytics. Then we will work on an end-to-end use-case where we want to analyze the Bufficorn NFT token and create different metrics and visualizations based on onchain and POAP metadata. This will be an end-to-end workshop where the data querying/gathering, data preprocessing and visualization will be addressed.
