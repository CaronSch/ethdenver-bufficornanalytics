# INTRODUCTION TO BLOCKCHAIN DATA ANALYTICS: POAP NFT USE CASE



This workshop is an introduction to blockchain data analysis for people interested in coding and data analytics/science. Workshop will be friendly for code beginners with python knowledge. Bring your laptop and code along! Starting point is a short introduction to blockchain data analytics, it's use-cases and an overview of toolings for blockchain data analytics. Then we will work on an end-to-end use-case where we want to analyze the POAP NFT token and create different metrics and visualizations based on onchain and POAP metadata. Also there will be cross chain integration and comparision of data between Ethereum and xDai. This will be an end-to-end workshop where the data querying/gathering, data preprocessing and visualization will be addressed.
